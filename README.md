## Platform Documentation

If you want to know about the platform, follow our [Platform Documentation](platform/home.md). It will help you understand how to use the platform and get you started.&#x20;

## Get started with a Channel

Quickly get started with sending notifications to a channel.&#x20;

* [Send Push Notifications](push/sending-push.md)
* [Send SMS](sms/sending-sms/)
* [Send Email](email/sending-email.md)
* [Send WhatsApp](whatsapp/sending-whatsapp.md)
* [Send Voice messages](voice/sending-voice.md)
* [Send Slack](others/slack.md)
* [Send Webhooks](others/webhooks.md)

## API Reference

Please check the API Reference section for all API docs.

## Credentials

* Your Account has an API Key. Go to `Settings tab > Account` to view your API key.&#x20;
* Similarly, the App you created has an App identifier called App ID. You can view it in the `Settings tab > App`.&#x20;

You will need both these credentials in the API to trigger notifications.

## Sandbox

To help you fiddle with the platform, we have a sandbox created with default integrations in place. Check sandbox details [here](sandbox.md).
