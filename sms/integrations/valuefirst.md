# ValueFirst SMS

### Step 1. **Account Setup** <a href="#account-setup" id="account-setup"></a>

If you do not have an account with ValueFirst yet, you will have to create an enterprise account by contacting their support [here](https://www.vfirst.com/say-ahoy). Once you have registered yourself on DLT and created an ValueFirst account, you can then add ValueFirst Integration in Raven.

[ðŸ“˜](https://emojipedia.org/blue-book/)  **Note:** \
If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the setup done.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports <a href="#delivery-reports" id="delivery-reports"></a>

There is no additional configuration required to setup delivery reports. Raven manages the delivery callback internally for ValueFirst.

#### Send additional parameters to ValueFirst

Raven sends the fields present in the SMS template to ValueFirst by default. To send additional fields, please check our [Override doc](../template.md#additional-fields) here. &#x20;
