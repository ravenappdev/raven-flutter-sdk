# Gupshup SMS

### Step 1. **Account Setup** <a href="#account-setup" id="account-setup"></a>

If you do not have an account with Gupshup yet, you will have to create an enterprise account by contacting their support [here](https://enterprise.smsgupshup.com). Once you have registered yourself on DLT and created an Gupshup account, you can then add Gupshup Integration in Raven.

If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the setup done.
