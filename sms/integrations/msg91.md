# MSG91 SMS

### Step 1. **Account Setup** <a href="#account-setup" id="account-setup"></a>

If you do not have an account with MSG91 yet, create an account [here](https://msg91.com). You would need to get your MSG91 approved before starting to send SMS. Follow the doc [here](https://help.msg91.com/article/359-my-account-status-is-in-demo-what-can-i-do-to-make-my-account-live) to get the account approved.

If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the setup done.
