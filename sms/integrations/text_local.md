# TextLocal SMS

### Step 1. **Account Setup** <a href="#account-setup" id="account-setup"></a>

If you do not have an account with TextLocal yet, create one by signing up [here](https://www.textlocal.com/signup/). Once you have registered yourself on DLT and created an TextLocal account, you can then add TextLocal Integration in Raven.

[ðŸ“˜](https://emojipedia.org/blue-book/)  **Note:** \
If you are sending SMSs in India, TRAI has mandated to register their business, headers (sender IDs), and templates on any of the DLT platforms. Follow the guide [here](https://www.textlocal.in/tcccpr-trai-dlt-registration/) to get the setup done.

#### Send additional parameters to TextLocal

Raven sends the fields present in the SMS template to TextLocal by default. To send additional fields, please check our [Override doc](../template.md#additional-fields) here. &#x20;

#### IP Whitelisting

You can control access by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure Raven's IP addresses are whitelisted and not blocked.

> #### IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
