# Twilio Voice

### Step 1. **Account Setup**

If you do not have an account with Twilio yet, create an account [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account). The setup will also guide you to get a caller number to make voice calls.



### Step 2. Twilio Integration in Raven <a href="#integration-keys" id="integration-keys"></a>

| Keys            | Details                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Account SID** | Twilio Account SID. You can find it [here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                              |
| **Auth Key**    | Twilio Account Token. You can find it [here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                            |
| **From**        | This must be a Twilio phone number that you own. Create one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search). |



### Step 3. Delivery Reports <a href="#delivery-reports" id="delivery-reports"></a>

There is no additional configuration required to setup delivery reports. Raven manages the delivery callback internally for Twilio.
