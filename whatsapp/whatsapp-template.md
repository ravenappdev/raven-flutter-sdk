# WhatsApp Template

Raven provides a simple way to add your WhatsApp templates that can be sent via any provider. You can either add the Template Name or the exact text message.&#x20;

#### WhatsApp registration and template approval

To start sending WhatsApp messages, you need to get yourself your Facebook Business Manager account registered and verified. Once done you can proceed with WhatsApp account registration and template approval. Your provider would help you with the whole process. Once your templates are registered with WhatsApp, you can use the 'Template Name' or the exact message content in the Raven WhatsApp template.

Raven only supports sending WhatsApp text template messages as of now. Support for media messages and session messaging would be added soon.
