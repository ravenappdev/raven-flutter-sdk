# Environment

Environment helps you signify the type of App. There are three App environments:

1. **DEVELOPMENT:**\
   ****A working environment to play around with the platform. \
   ****
2.  **STAGING:**\
    ****Used for testing to test changes before releasing them to Production. Similar to the staging environment that you would have in your backend.


3. **PRODUCTION:**\
   ****This is the live production environment and should be treated carefully since it could affect your users.

ðŸª§**Info:** \
Currently, Environments are only for your understanding and to add a semantic meaning to Apps. We do intend to add Environment based API rate-limiting later on.
